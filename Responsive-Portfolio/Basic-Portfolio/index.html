		<section id="main-bio">	
				<p> I lived in Osawatomie,Ks my entire life until 4 years ago. I went to Osawatomie High School while working at Mcdonalds, my freshman through sophmore years, this is where I first learned people are ass wholes. Junior and Senior year I worked at Osawatomie State Hospital, where I learned the fine lines between the mentally insane and sane. Moving out of my parents house shortly after high school supporting myself off of a decent salary from Wal-Mart Distribution center learning the values of hard work and the toles bending over and throwing boxes has on ones body. Three years later I have a morgage on a house working as a contruction worker, measure twice cut once, do things right the first time or redo them later.

				<p style="text-indent: 40px"> Relationship issues at 23 walked me right into a better relationship where I would leave my world behind. Kansas city became home and Time Warner Cable became my employer. Learned that people live in some incrediable ways, wealth is irrelevant to living conditions. Two years later I caught wind of Google fiber and road out on that zephyr. Been there since and loving life. I have learned so much about Networking, splicing, running pilots, training people, managing teams, how to tactifully tell someone there not doing something correct. Time to become a Developer and live the life I want to live instead of the one I was given.
